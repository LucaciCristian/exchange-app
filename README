Please develop a Java application which allows users to exchange money from one currency to another.
The application will get real-life (and real-time) information from the following address, which offers an XML document:
https://www.bnr.ro/nbrfxrates.xml
As you already know, XML is a kind of document which structures information.

Be aware that BNR (Banca Nationala a Romaniei) limits the number of daily downloads for this document.
Therefore, you will access the document and save its contents to a local file first. My suggestion is to "download"
its contents using a stream of bytes.

The user interface will allow the user to enter the source currency, an amount they want to exchange, and a destination
currency.
The program has to display the calculated value.

Also, please implement a mechanism which allows the user to see all currencies and their exchange rates as a table on
the screen.
Optional: The user will be able to choose how to sort the list: based on the currencies names, or based on the exchange
rate values - ascending and descending
